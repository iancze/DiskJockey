Compared to the masses of their older cousins on the main sequence, however, the masses of young pre-main sequence stars are relatively uncertain. Fortunately, young stars have a unique advantage that we can exploit to precisely infer their mass: many often host a protoplanetary disk made of gas and dust, the site of future and ongoing planet formation. By modeling the rotation of this disk, we can dynamically &quot;weigh&quot; the host star(s). Circumstellar disks are typically mm-bright, which means that interferometers like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) are ideal instruments for deriving stellar masses.</p><p>In this short intro, I will explain how we can use the kinematic fingerprint of the disk–imprinted by disk rotation–to derive precise estimates of the stellar mass.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Disk-geometry-and-rotation-1" href="#Disk-geometry-and-rotation-1">Disk geometry and rotation</a></h2><p>Astronomers typically model the structure of these protoplanetary disks as an axisymmetric disk with radial surface density defined by a power law and vertical structure set by hydrostatic equilibrium. As we will see, the orientation of the disk relative to us has a profound effect on what we observe. We define the inclination of the disk <span>$i$</span> as the angle between the disk angular momentum axis and the observer: <span>$0^\circ$</span> inclination means the disk is viewed face-on (appearing on the sky as a circle), while <span>$90^\circ$</span> inclination means the disk is viewed edge-on (appearing on the sky as a thin line).</p><p><img src="assets/disk.svg" alt="disk"/></p><p>The disk orbits the central stellar mass under the force of gravity, yielding velocities dictated by Kepler&#39;s law. Although there is evidence that due to pressure support gas disks rotate at slightly sub-Keplerian speeds, creating a headwind for any larger dust aggregates and solids (the meter-sized barrier), this effect is negligible when determining stellar mass. For more information about disk structure, check out the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150906382A">lecture notes by Phil Armitage</a>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Disk-emission-mechanisms-1" href="#Disk-emission-mechanisms-1">Disk emission mechanisms</a></h2><p>Active young stars and their circumstellar disks can emit radiation at a host of wavelengths from the X-ray to the radio. When observing at sub-mm and radio wavelengths, there are two main sources of emission: Thermal continuum emission from the dust and spectral line emission from molecular species like carbon monoxide (CO).</p><p>Owing to the high spatial resolution of an interferometer, it is possible to spatially resolve many circumstellar disks. If we set the frequency sampling finely enough, then we will have a dataset that is both spatially resolved (an image showing emission on many scales) and spectrally resolved (an image for every frequency we observe). This set of images is called a data cube or a series of <strong>channel maps</strong>.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Dust-emission-1" href="#Dust-emission-1">Dust emission</a></h3><p>The intensity of continuum emission from the dust is related to the density and temperature of the emitting material. Because dust emission spans a continuum of frequencies, channel maps with fine frequency spacing yield little additional information–-typically these are summed together to yield greater sensitivity. Below is a movie showing what the dust emission looks like as we vary some of the key disk parameters: the <strong>radius</strong> of the disk, the <strong>inclination</strong> of the disk, and the <strong>stellar mass</strong> (stellar flux is kept fixed). In the movie, each parameter starts at an intermediate value, is then decreased to a minimum value, then increased to a maximum value, and then decreased back to the starting value. In this movie, the changes you will notice are due to variations in the radius and inclination of the disk.</p><p><img src="assets/dust.gif" alt="dust video"/></p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Spectral-line-emission-1" href="#Spectral-line-emission-1">Spectral line emission</a></h3><p>When we observe the disk in narrow frequency channels at the location of spectral line emission, like CO <span>$J=2-1$</span>, we see the kinematic fingerprint of the disk. Each image shows the disk emission at a specific frequency, corresponding to the blue-shift (-velocity) or red-shift (+velocity) of the CO line, due to the projected velocity along the line of sight.</p><p>Why the morphology of the line emission appears as it does isn&#39;t immediately obvious. Primarily, the shape of the emission is a function of the Keplerian rotation: the inner part of the disk rotates faster than the outer part of the disk and thus imparts a more substantial velocity shift to the line emission from these regions of the disk.</p><p>As the parameters of the disk change, the projected velocity can change dramatically. For example, compare the difference between <span>$i \approx 0^\circ$</span> and <span>$i \approx 90^\circ$</span>! If the disk is more inclined towards face on (<span>$0^\circ$</span>), the projection of the velocity along the line of sight will reduced and we will see more emission concentrated around 0 km/s.</p><p><img src="assets/gas.gif" alt="Gas Video"/></p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Interferometers-measure-complex-visibilities-1" href="#Interferometers-measure-complex-visibilities-1">Interferometers measure complex visibilities</a></h2><p>Although we may be used to looking at emission in the <em>image plane</em>, interferometers measure the Fourier transform of the sky brightness in the <em>visibility plane</em>. This next movie shows what the Fourier transform of each channel map looks like. As you can see, the Fourier transform looks quite different from the image.</p><p><img src="assets/vis.gif" alt="Visibilities Video"/></p><p>This Fourier plane is sampled according to the baselines formed between antennae separations. Below is a typical sampling pattern for an observation with the SMA.</p><p><img src="assets/uv_spacings.png" alt="UV Spacings"/></p><p>Every dot represents a sampling of the Fourier transform in the UV plane. Some of the samplings are spaced so close together in space that they smear together into a line.</p><footer><hr/><a class="previous" href="index.html"><span class="direction">Previous</span><span class="title">Home</span></a><a class="next" href="models.html"><span class="direction">Next</span><span class="title">Models</span></a></footer></article></body></html>
